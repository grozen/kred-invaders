# Kred Invaders

It's space invaders for the digital payments age!

This is essentially a space-invaders implementation utilizing [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/) that ended up teaching me quite a bit about Javascript, working on open-source projects and how to do unspeakable things using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

## I want to play the thing!
If you've missed the link, [here it is again](http://grozen.github.io/kred-invaders/).

## I want to build the thing!
By all means, though there's no "building" per-se involved.

### Prerequisites
You're going to need a few things to get the project up and running:

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
2. [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

### Actually running the thing
All you have to do is clone the repo and run the following in the resulting folder:

```
bundle install
```

Once that's done, just run:

```
bundle exec middleman
```

and you should be able to reach the game by navigating to http://0.0.0.0:4567

(Your mileage my vary depending on your OS, but this should work even on Windows)

## How did I make the thing?
Here are the various tools I used to make Kred Invaders:

* [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/) - A snazzy component-based HTML5 game framework with an amazing group of maintainers and a great community.
* [MiddleMan](https://middlemanapp.com/) - Still my go-to solution for static websites.
* [Aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org/) - Cross-platform pixel editor that is simply a delight to use. Use it and be delighted.
* [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) - For all those bleeps and bloops.
